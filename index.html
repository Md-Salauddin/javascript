	<script type="text/javascript">
		// 1# common way to display data in html
		document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My name is Md: Salauddin"
		// 2# It will erase all html content and just print this line [after load]

		// 3# Alert [note: we can skip window, as it is available in browser we can say its a global variable]
		alert("This is a test alert message, as i learning it")
		// 4# It will show browser console [note: we will use it as debug purpose]

	<!--  DAY 2 -->
	<!-- JS STATEMENT -->
	<!-- # instruction are called statement, js program is list of statement.
		 composed of: values, operators, expressions, keywords, comments
		 # execute one by one, the same order as it written.
	 -->

	 <!--  JS VALUE -->
	 <!-- Two type 
	      1. literal(Fixed)[10, 10.5, "hello"] 
	      2. variable [store data value, use keyword like var, let, const]
		  var a; [declaration]
		  a = 5; [assign] 
	  -->

	  <!-- OPERATORS -->
	  <!-- arithmetic: +, -, *, /
	  	   assignment: =
	   -->

	  <!-- LET & VAR -->
	  <!-- var: we can declar it many time as we want
	       var a = 5;
	       var a = 2;

	       let[same as val in kotlin]
	       -> cann't be re redeclared
	       -> must be declar before use
	       let a = 5;
	       a = 2; // not allowed 
	   -->

	   <!-- BLOCK SCOPE -->
	   <!--
	       { // global scope
				{
					// block scope
					let x = 5;
					var y = 3;
				}
				// x cann't be used here
				// but y can be [read note#1]
	       } 
		[note#1: for that reasone 'let' introduced into js]
	    -->

	    <!-- REDECLARING -->
	    <!-- 
	    	EXAMPLE#1
		    	let x = 1;     // allowed
		    	x = 2;         // not allowed

		    EXAMPLE#2
		    	let x = 1;     // allowed
		    	{
					let x = 2; // allowed
					x = 3;     // not allowed
		    	}

		    	{
					let x = 3; // allowed
					x = 4;     // not allowed

		    EXAMPLE#3
		    	let x = 1;     // allowed
